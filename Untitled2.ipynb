First, they cannot identify the relations between weights of stock-picking concepts and performances of portfolios. Second, they cannot systematically discover the optimal combination for weights of concepts to optimize the performances. Third, they are unable to meet various investorsâ€™ preferences. This study aims to more efficiently construct weighted scoring stock selection models to overcome these disadvantages. Since the weights of stock-picking concepts in a weighted scoring stock selection model can be regarded as components in a mixture, we used the simplex centroid mixture design to obtain the experimental sets of weights. These sets of weights are simulated with US stock market historical data to obtain their performances. Performance prediction models were built with the simulated performance data set and artificial neural networks. Furthermore, the optimization models to reflect investorsâ€™ preferences were built up, and the performance prediction models were employed as the kernel of the optimization models so that the optimal solutions can now be solved with optimization techniques. The empirical values of the performances of the optimal weighting combinations generated by the optimization models showed that they can meet various investorsâ€™ preferences and outperform those of S&Pâ€™s 500 not only during the training period but also during the testing period.', 'purpose': None, 'funded_by': None, 'instances_represent': None, 'recommended_data_splits': None, 'sensitive_data': None, 'preprocessing_description': None, 'variable_info': 'The inputs are the weights of the stock-picking concepts as follows\\r\\nX1=the weight of the Large B/P concept\\r\\nX2=the weight of the Large ROE concept\\r\\nX3=the weight of the Large S/P concept\\r\\nX4=the weight of the Large Return Rate in the last quarter concept\\r\\nX5=the weight of the Large Market Value concept\\r\\nX6=the weight of the Small systematic Risk concept\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outputs are the investment performance indicators (normalized) as follows\\r\\nY1=Annual Return\\r\\nY2=Excess Return\\r\\nY3=Systematic Risk\\r\\nY4=Total Risk\\r\\nY5=Abs.
